You can look at this project clicking on Environments/Production.
This project was created to show my skills in React and Node.
To use this app you have to login/signup.
After that you can add and delete text blogs. Also, you can open a single blog and open other pages.
You can see only blogs that were created by yourself.
This is the first version of this app. I am planning on adding more features such as: adding pictures, tags, search and so on.
Thank you for visiting this repo!
